Now that this effort has been successful, many Republicans are doing all they can to pretend that this isn t as serious as it is, since it benefits their party and chosen American leader. However, one American hero is FURIOUS with his fellow Republicans over their response to these Russian hacks, and that is former prisoner of war and Arizona Senator John McCain.Senator McCain appeared on CNN s State of the Union on Sunday morning, and had some very strong warnings for those who refuse to take the fact that Russia hacked our elections for the threat to this great republic that it is. McCain said to host Jake Tapper: This is the sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II, which has made one of the most peaceful periods in the history of the world. This is serious business. If they re able to harm the electoral process, they may destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections. Because of the gravity of this situation, McCain is going up against his fellow Republicans and calling for a special committee to investigate the activities of the Russians and especially Vladimir Putin, and insists that it must be done in a timely and bipartisan fashion, without regard for political gains or consequences. Thus far, McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham are the only ones being forceful here, as the two most powerful Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are instead choosing to roll over for Donald Trump. However, McCain isn t letting up. He has written a letter to McConnell, signed by fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY) and Democratic Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). The letter said, in part: Cyber is the rare kind of all-encompassing challenge for which the Congress s jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action. Only a select committee that is time-limited, cross-jurisdictional, and purpose-driven can address the challenge of cyber,  the letter said.  We believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem. This is what bipartisan patriotism looks like. Direct threats to our democracy like what Russia has done is nothing to play with simply because it benefits one s own party. I never though I d say this, but why can t more Republicans be like John McCain and Lindsey Graham?McCain continued to Tapper: There s no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we ve been totally paralyzed. I m sure that when Vladimir Putin was told quote  cut it out  unquote, I m sure that Vladimir Putin immediately stopped all cyber-activities. The truth is, they are hacking every single day. So true. This is a threat that must be met head on, and with as much force as possible, party politics be damned. Our very way of life depends upon it.Watch McCain s remarks below:[ad3media campaign= 1398 ]Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"All we re hearing from the left is fear mongering about President Trump s budget. We love what welfare to work is coming back after Obama stripped it out of requirements to receive benefits. Food stamp enrollment exploded during Obama s 8 years in office to be 44 million recipients.The American taxpayers are footing the bill for those who take advantage of the system. Here s the TRUTH about what the Trump administration has proposed for food stamps:WORK REQUIREMENTS: In reality, the president s proposed policy is based on two principles: requiring able-bodied adult recipients to work or prepare for work in exchange for benefits, and restoring minimal fiscal responsibility to state governments for the welfare programs they operate.The president s budget reasserts the basic concept that welfare should not be a one-way handout. Welfare should, instead, be based on reciprocal obligations between recipients and taxpayers.SHIFTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON STATES:Why should the federal government pay for almost all of the freebies? Shifting the responsibility to the states will help with accountability. Perhaps some of the states will make a better effort to clean up the fraud that s so rampant in the system.Read more: Daily Signal\",\n          \"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government could use constitutional powers to suspend Catalonia s autonomy and prevent the region from splitting from Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an interview to newspaper El Pais published late on Saturday. Asked if he was ready to trigger the article 155 of the constitution, which enables him to sack the regional government and call a fresh local election, Rajoy answered:  I don t rule out absolutely anything that is within the law ... Ideally, it shouldn t be necessary to implement extreme solutions but for that not to happen things would have to be changed.  Rajoy also said he planned to leave in Catalonia the extra 4,000 police officers the government had shipped in to region for an independence vote on Oct. 1 until the crisis was over.  The conservative prime minister added he would not call a snap national election as a result of the political crisis and  ruled out using mediation to resolve it. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
